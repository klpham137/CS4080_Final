# Dart A Final Project
- Single Player Yahtzee Game

## Program Structure
### dice page
- create dice object or "create dice" method and add 5 of them to the game UI each with their own logic to roll
- should be the landing page on app opening
- method to roll
- things to include on page: roll button, see score button -> score sheet popup

### score sheet
- a whole new dart file for organization
- maybe open as a dialog box when each round of dice is rolled
- method to dynamically calculate score
